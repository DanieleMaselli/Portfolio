          This project was realized in collaboration with the
          <b>SPUR.lab (Site Specific Augmented Storytelling lab)</b>, which is a
          Potsdam-based interdisciplinary research group focused on the
          investigation and development of new narrative forms of National
          Socialism and the Former concentration camps in Brandenburg.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text grid-span-3">
          The pilot prototype explores new digital storytelling and educational
          formats directly in the browser and serves as an alternative way to
          preserve the voices that witness the atrocities of the National
          Socialism period in Germany.

          Collaboration with SPUR.lab and the media library of Sachsenhausen
        </h2>

        <p class="project-text">
          The collaboration and the support received from the memorial site of
          Sachsenhausen allowed me to gain access to the auditive audio guide
          that enable the visitors to discover the vast complexity of the
          historical establishment in the former concentration camp.
        </p>

          src="../asset/spatial/audioguide.jpg"

        />
        <p class="project-text-description grid-span-text reveal-type">
          The collection of the media library consists of over 200 eyewitness
          testimonies that are preserved partly as the original recording,
          partly as transcribed material.
        </p>

        <h2>The perception of multitude and the singular voice</h2>
        <p class="project-text">
          One of the main interpretations that is posed with this prototype is
          the usage of digital technologies for the expression of the
          instinctive reaction of the human mind facing any tragedy that may
          involve a community. Thus, the main principle underlying this project
          is the perception of a singular voice in comparison to a thousand,
          that changes how we feel emotionally.
        </p>

        <img

        <h2>History in virtual worlds - Technical implementation</h2>
        <p class="project-text">
          The design of an interactive audio experience requires an initial
          research aimed at finding of the right technology that could be
          adopted in the prototype. In this work, the principal goal was firstly
          to allow the use of regular PC audio in the web browser and link it to
          different audio scenes. Each file is located in a specific location
          within the digital space, thus allowing the creation of reference
          points for navigation. In this way, thanks to listening through
          headphones, it is possible to recreate a situation in which one is in
          the midst of people telling their story, though without being able to
          distinguish any of them. Moving towards the different spots where the
          audio files are located, it will be possible to distinguish the voice
          and the story contained in it.
        </p>
        <h2>Main scene - The dark virtual space</h2>
        <img
          src="../asset/spatial/Bild_8.jpg"
          class="project-image grid-span-3"
        />
        <p class="project-text-description grid-span-text reveal-type">
          This image shows the first screen of the prototype. By entering the
          first virtual scene, the user is caught by a dark environment with
          various beams of lights located in different spots at a specific
          distance between each other. In this scene, the user hears a slight
          buzz of voices in the background made up by the different voices of
          the testimonies that are pulled together in an indistinguishable way.
        </p>

        <h2>Moving inside the virtual audio space</h2>
        <img
          src="../asset/spatial/Bild_1.jpg"
          class="project-image grid-span-3"
        />
        <p class="project-text-description grid-span-text reveal-type">
          By moving within the initially dark virtual scene, the positional
          audio allows the user to decide how to navigate according to the
          direction the voices are coming from. Every voice is indeed anchored
          to a specific beam of light. The volume of the voice linked to that
          spot increases by moving closer and closer to it, until the arrival at
          the center of the cone of light, where only one specific voice can be
          distinct and heard.
        </p>
        <h2>The audio testimony scene</h2>
        <img
          src="../asset/spatial/Bild_7.jpg"
          class="project-image grid-span-3"
        />
        <p class="project-text-description grid-span-text reveal-type">
          Inside each specific cone of light, the volume of the audio is at its
          maximum level and it is not possible to hear other voices anymore.
          This gives space to the testimony speech to be clear without any
          external interferences. As additional information, the names and a
          brief description of the person are shown to complement the audio
          story.
